# A/B-Testing

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. 

## Project overview
For this project, i will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run for an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Project objectives 
This is a project that I was working on for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Statmodels to make my analysis easier.

## Conclusion
### *What I learned*
* Use statistical techniques ( probabibility, A/B tests, Hypothesis testing, Logistic regression) to answer questions about the data.
* Report  conclusions and recommendations in a report.
### *Evaluation*
My project was reviewed by a Udacity reviewer. All criteria found in the rubric must be meeting specifications for me to pass.
